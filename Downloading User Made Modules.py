#   downloading new modules, made by other users
# =============================================================================
# When python is downloaded to your computer, it comes with built in
# functions, such as the print() or enuerate() functions
#
# These built in functions are often insufficient for our purposes, and many
# online users have created amazing modules that are freely accessible,
# for instance, the pygame module allows us to create fun games n python.
#
# To find useful modules, we can head to:
#   https://pypi.org
# A free site that allows users to upload modules they've created
# =============================================================================
# In the Visual Studio Code Terminal:
#   pip install (name of module)
#
#   (or if the above didn't work)
#
#   python -m pip install (name of module)
#
# For instance, we would first download the pygame module, then open a comand window
# and type: pip install pygame
